# TorDetector
Tor detect is a python3 script used to detect the Tor network connectivity from a given csv file(Like, a wireshark file which is exported as csv). It used to scan the whole IP addresses from that file with the Tor Nodes and print if someone is connected to Tor Network according to the given csv file. There is also a manual ip search(want to check single ip) that code is also available in the script which is commented and instruction are given there as well for execution.
